## Overview

Introduces Big O Notation this is due to the previous chapters label algorithms simply as the numbers of steps they'll take this isn't practical to do because the input given into a function will vary the time it will take to complete it's task.

The more effective way is to quantity the efficiency of an algorithm so for example a linear search we can say this will take a number of N steps

Big O and the run times:

- O(N) the term N is used for the number of elements in a input for example a number of elements in an array can be N elements.

- O(1) this one will take one step this no matter the number of elements the arguments from a function will have.

- O(log N) in simple terms this runtime will increase as the data is double an example of an algorithm that has a runtime of this is the Binary Search. The log in the runtime is short for Logarithms this the reverse of an exponent:

  - 2\*\*3 is the equivalent of: 2 x 2 x 2
