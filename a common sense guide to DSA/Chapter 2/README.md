## Overview

Presents a new data structure (Ordered Arrays) & presents two algorithms to search the data within the array

The two algorithms are:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

With an array containing 100 values, here are the maximum number of steps
each type of search would take:

- Linear search: 100 steps
- Binary search: 7 steps
