## Overview

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the following data structures stacks and queues

Essentially stacks and queues are arrays with abstractions of their functionalities

## Stacks:

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

These operations usually include:

    push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
    pop: Remove and return the item at the top of the stack.
    peek: Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
    isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
    size: Return the number of elements in the stack.

## Queues:

Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Similar to stacks, queues can be implemented using arrays with abstraction.

Abstraction in a queue implementation involves providing operations such as:

    enqueue: Add an item to the back of the queue.
    dequeue: Remove and return the item at the front of the queue.
    peek: Return the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
    isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
    size: Return the number of elements in the queue.
